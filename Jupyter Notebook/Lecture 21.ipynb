You can come up with richer score functions that allow you to compare any two hands.\n",

This takes a list of anything, and produces a new list with the elements ordered so that each element is `<` than the next one.

    "The `Player` class is considerably simpler.  Each `Player` will start with a name (\"Computer\" by default), and no hand (designated by the value `None`).  There is a function that allows each `Player` to `receive_hand()`; this function assigns `self._hand` to be a new `Hand`, which means that this function need a `Deck` as outside argument to work properly.  A `Player` may also `trade()` cards from their `self._hand`: this function requires a list of cards to trade AND a `Deck` to draw from -- and this function will take advantage of the `update()` function.  Finally, `get_hand()` will simply return `self._hand`, which we can then compare or display."
