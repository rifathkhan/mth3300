    "Problem: compute the area under the curve $y = f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$.  In other words, compute $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can sometimes use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, to find an antiderivative which you can evaluate.  But sometimes that doesn't work, because either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $f(x)$ doesn't have an elementary antiderivative (like in your homework), or\n",
    "* $f(x)$ is some observed function, for which you don't even have a formula!\n",
    "\n",
    "For these problems, it's hopeless to get an exact answer, but you can come up with good approximations by numerical methods.  The plain old Riemann sum is the simplest method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly more sophisticated method is the trapezoidal rule (*not* the one on your homework).  Suppose that you had to estimate $\\int_2^8 \\sqrt{1+x^4} dx$.  That function, $\\sqrt{1+x^4}$, is impossible to antidifferentiate (in terms of elementary functions -- logs, trigs, etc).  So, here's what we'll do instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a value of $N$, the larger the better, like $N = 100$.\n",
    "2. Divide the interval $[2,8]$ of $x$-values into $100$ equal \"pieces\".  Since the width of the full interval is $6$, each piece should be of width $.06$.  The $x$-values where you cut should be $x_0 = 2$, $x_1 = 2.06$, $x_2 = 2.12$, ... $x_{99} = 7.94$, $x_{100} = 8$.  (Test: what should $x_{43}$ be?)\n",
    "3. Now, we'll graph $\\sqrt{1+x^4}$. Well, not exactly: what we'll *really* do is plot 101 points -- the $x$-values I just gave you, and the corresponding $y$-values (evaluated by substituting the $x$ values into $\\sqrt{1+x^4}$).   We'll get a bunch of dots.  Now, connect the dots by **straight line segments**.  What you'll have now is a \"straight line\" graph that nonetheless looks a lot like the graph of $y = \\sqrt{1+x^4}$.\n",
    "4. Finally, find the area under **this** graph, by thinking of it as 100 trapezoidal slices.  The area of each slice will be $(\\mbox{left y value} + \\mbox{right y value})\\cdot \\frac{width}{2}$.  You add those together, and that's the area under the straight-line graph -- very close to the area under the true graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the abstract: to estimate $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$, you take the entire interval $[a,b]$; you divide into $N$ parts, each of width $\\Delta x$.  Let $x_i = a + i\\Delta x$.  The sum of the areas turns out to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}(1f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \\ldots + 2f(x_{N-1}) + 1f(x_N))$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your homework* uses a slightly different rule: Simpson's rule, which is based on connecting triples of points by parabolic arcs instead of connecting pairs of points by straight lines.  The formula for that rule turns out to be\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\Delta x}{3}(1f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \\ldots + 4f(x_{N-1}) + 1f(x_N))$ \n",
    "\n",
    "with alternating 4's and 2's.  How should you program this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: first, **do it by hand** once (with a small value of $N$) -- focus on procedure, not value.  Secondly, a question you should think about: imagine you were using this formula to estimate $\\int_2^8 \\sqrt{1+x^4} dx$ with $N = 500$.  How would calculate the value of the, say, 43rd term (that would be $4f(x_{42})$ or $2f(x_{42})$ -- wait, which one)?  Think about that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do yourself a favor and make your variables match my notation.  For instance, I have a variable called $x_i$ -- you might want to make a variable named `x_i`.  My `i` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., N; perhaps you build a loop that does the same thing."
