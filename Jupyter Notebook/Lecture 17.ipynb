    "\n",
    "Last time we talked about scoping: this refers to how variables defined in functions (local variables) are only accessible within those functions, not outside.  Scoping helps avoid name conflicts; if you accidentally create two variables with the same name in different functions, Python will be able to keep them straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoping does have one downside: a function can't refer to variables that are defined outside of itself. (Technically, you can use global variables if they are *only* read, and *never* assigned values in the function -- but even then, it is strongly frowned upon.) Therefore, if your function needs to know the value of some variable, you **ought to pass that as a parameter**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of bad code.  I have a account, which starts with principal P.  Every now and then, I want to add some interest.  I do this by supplying a value of r and and a value of t, using the formula $$A = Pe^{rt}$$ -- or really, $$\\mbox{New value} = (\\mbox{Old value})e^{rt}$$  I write a function to do this ... sort of."
