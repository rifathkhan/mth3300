    "Recall that complex numbers are numbers of the form $a+bi$, where $a, b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the square root of $-1$.  So $5 + 7i$ is a complex number, as is $-4.2 - 6.1i$, as is $18$ (since $18 = 18 + 0i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are added via the rule $(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i$, and they are multiplied by the rule $(a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci +bdi^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.  So, before we get too far into it, let's quickly remider ourselves how these work:\n",
