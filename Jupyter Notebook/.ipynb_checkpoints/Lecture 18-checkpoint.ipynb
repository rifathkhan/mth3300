Indeed, it might be helpful to think about an object as just a bunch of related variables tied up with a bow.\n",

    "Consider the following description of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The game starts by getting the names of the players. Each\n",

    "The *nouns* should loosely correspond to classes. To be slightly more precise, the classes correspond to the concept; each particular instance is an object.  \"Card\" is a class, \"10 of spades\" is an object of that class.  You design the data type once (kind of like a template), and then use it all over your program(s) to define objects.  The attributes of an object are what you need to describe that object. E.g., for cards, the attributes would be the rank (10 for the card we mentioned before) and the suit (spades).  Every card has a rank, every card has a suit.  \n",

I placed this class in a **module**; the module is contained in the file `evans_card_v1.py`, which you can look it if you like -- or not.

And to be sure, if you look in my `evans_card_v1.py` file, you'll see that list.  But in the *client* code, you don't interact with the underlying list -- you just write code that corresponds to actions you would actually perform with cards, like `draw()`.   The list is the underlying way the data is stored -- that's the implementation -- but you only use the specially designed method -- that's the interface.\n",
    "* Ideally, when you design a class, you would like it to be usable not just once, but throughout a project or several projects.  That's why you might place one in a separate file -- instead of copying and pasting code to various files, you can simply have many files import the same module. \n",

    "Notice that in the last Mario example, the *client* code never makes reference to the attribute variables `m._name`, `m._coins`, and `m._lives`.  Instead, the creation, accessing and changing of these values for an object are done via **methods**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is sought after when you design a class. As the designer of a class, your goal is to design an interface (that is, a set of methods) that is strong enough to capture all the things a client might want to do with objects. To put it starkly:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code inside a class *definition* can reference attribute variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Client* code should try to NOT reference attribute variables -- it ought to only interact with ENTIRE objects, via methods.\n",

    "This idea is known as *encapsulation*.   So, the examples in the first section above are \"bad\", in that they violate encapsulation; the examples in the second section are \"better\", because they don't violate encapsulation.  \n",

    "Why is this so important?  Here's one way to look at it.  Let me give an analogy: when you drive a car, you don't manually turn the steering column, and you don't manually drip fuel into the engine.  When you *build* a car, you care about these things; if your car *isn't working*, you might want to look at these bits.  But if you're directly playing with the steering column and the fuel injector *while* you are driving, then, um, are you're sure you're driving correctly?  It sounds like you're not driving correctly.  Maybe you should pull over.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that the attribute variables are frequently thought of as technical details used to represent the object.  The user isn't meant to directly look at or modify them; instead, they ought to interact with them through the interface -- that is, the methods -- which (if well-designed) are guaranteed to access or modify objects in appropriate and safe ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the underscores in front of attribute names are a Python custom, meant to convey to other programmers who are using the class: \"hey, I am a technical detail! Don't reference me directly! If you *do* use me you'll probably screw something up, and it's your own fault then!  Be smart and use the interface instead!\"\n",
    "\n",
