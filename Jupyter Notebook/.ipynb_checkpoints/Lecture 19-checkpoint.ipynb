And to be sure, if you look in my `evans_card_v1.py` file, you'll see that list.  But in the *client* code, you don't interact with the underlying list -- you just write code that corresponds to actions you would actually perform with cards, like `draw()`.   The list is the underlying way the data is stored -- that's the implementation -- but you only use the specially designed method -- that's the interface.\n",

That's why you might place one in a separate file -- instead of copying and pasting code to various files, you can simply have many files import the same module. \n",
