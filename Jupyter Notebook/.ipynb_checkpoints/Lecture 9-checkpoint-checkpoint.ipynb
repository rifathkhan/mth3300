In that case, `range(<x>, <y>, <negative step>)` will count starting with `<x>`, and ending when it reaches a number **less than or equal to** `<y>`.  So in the presence of a negative step, `<x>` should really be the larger number.\n",
    "2. A `range()` isn't reallllllly a `list` if we're being entirely truthful.  Python does this mostly for the sake of efficiency.  Here's an analogy which hints at the thought process of Python's designers: imagine that I asked you to count from 1 to 100 out loud.  Would you write down those 100 numbers, and then when you're finished, read from the list?  Probably not.  Python creating an honest list out of 1 to 100 would be analogous to doing that; a Python range is analogous to what you actually do, which is to generate the next number on the fly.   \n",

But the last note won't really matter unless you try to use a `range` outside of a `for` loop -- and most of the time, when you think this is necessary, there's a better way to do what you're trying to do.  That said, for the few times where you actually need a true `list` version of a `range()`, you can write, e.g., `list(range(10))`. \n"
