There are 3 stages of merging: merging the individual elements into twosies; merging the twosies into foursies; and finally merging the foursies into the entire list.  The key idea is that: *in each stage, the total number of comparisons is roughly equal to the total length of the list*.  This is because each comparison will result in one number being merged into a list, and every number will be merged exactly once at each stage.\n",

    "Now, how many stages are there?  That would be around $\\log_2 n$ -- this is the number of times you can divide a list of length $n$ in 2 before you get onesies.
